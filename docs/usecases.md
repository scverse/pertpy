# Use cases

Our use cases showcase a variety of pertpy tools applied to one dataset.
They are designed to give you a sense of how to use pertpy in a real-world scenario.
The use cases featured here are those we present in the [pertpy preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.04.606516v1).
