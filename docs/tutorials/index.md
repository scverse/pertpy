# Tutorials

The easiest way to get familiar with pertpy is to follow along with our tutorials.
Many are also designed to work seamlessly in Google colab.

## Use cases
Our use cases showcase a variety of pertpy tools applied to one dataset.
They are designed to give you a sense of how to use pertpy in a real-world scenario.
The use cases featured here are those we present in the pertpy [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.04.606516v1).

## Glossary

```{eval-rst}
.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: AnnData

        `AnnData <https://github.com/scverse/anndata>`_ is short for Annotated Data and is the primary datastructure that pertpy uses.
        It is based on the principle of a single Numpy matrix X embraced by two Pandas Dataframes.
        All rows are called observations (in our case cells or similar) and the columns
        are known as variables (any feature such as e.g. genes or similar).
        For a more in depth introduction please read the `AnnData paper <https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.16.473007>`_.
